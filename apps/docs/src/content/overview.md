# Overview

Bringing bold and functional Design to your project.

Welcome to MeUI, a comprehensive UI Kit designed specifically for use with Tailwind CSS, and tailored for [Meprovas](https://meprovas.com), an educational platform. MeUI embraces the Neo Brutalism style, known for its bold, straightforward design elements, prominent borders, and distinct shadows, creating a modern and clean aesthetic.

## What's MeUI?

MeUI is a carefully crafted set of UI components and design guidelines, aimed at streamlining the development process and ensuring consistency across your applications. Built with Tailwind CSS, MeUI offers flexibility and ease of customization, enabling you to create visually appealing and functional user interfaces efficiently.

### What is Neo Brutalism?

Neo Brutalism is a design style that draws inspiration from the Brutalist architectural movement, which emerged in the mid-20th century. The core principle of Neo Brutalism in UI design is to embrace raw simplicity and honesty in materials and structures. It emphasizes function over form, stripping away unnecessary decorations to focus on the essential elements of design. The purpose of Neo Brutalism is to create designs that are not only aesthetically striking but also highly functional and user-centric.

### Key Features
