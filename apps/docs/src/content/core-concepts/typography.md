# Typography

The typography in MeUI follows the principles of Neo Brutalism, characterized by bold and functional design elements. For MeUI, we have chosen **Public Sans**, a sans-serif font that complements the style's aesthetic.

### Key Characteristics

1. **Sans-Serif Dominance:** Reflecting the Neo Brutalism style, sans-serif fonts like Public Sans are preferred for their clean and modern appearance. They provide clarity and straightforwardness, essential for maintaining the minimalist aesthetic.

2. **Large Font Sizes for Headings:** Headings in MeUI are typically set in large font sizes, creating a strong visual impact and clear hierarchy in the layout. This approach draws attention to key sections and makes the content easily scannable.

3. **Experimentation with Line Height and Letter Spacing:** MeUI allows for flexible adjustments in line height and letter spacing to enhance readability and visual appeal. This experimentation helps in achieving the desired balance between text density and white space, essential in maintaining a clean and uncluttered design.

4. **Typography as a Decorative Element:** In Neo Brutalism, typography is not just functional but also decorative. It plays a crucial role in defining the overall visual style of the interface. Bold and distinctive typographic choices help reinforce the design's character and engage users.

These typographic choices help ensure that MeUI remains both functional and visually appealing, adhering to the minimalist yet bold aesthetics of Neo Brutalism.
